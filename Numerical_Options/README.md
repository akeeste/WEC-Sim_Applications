**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Geometry:**	Ellipsoid

Example that compares various numerical options in WEC-Sim. This case compares the differential equation solver `time step settings <https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#time-step-features>`_ (``ode4, ode45``), the `convolution integral <https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/theory.html#convolution-integral-formulation>`_ and the `state-space <https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/theory.html#state-space>`_ representations. Execute the `run_NumOpt.m` script to run this case.
